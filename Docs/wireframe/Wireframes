I created a basic version wireframe version of what Sipe&Bite could look like. I created a basic login/signup page, and then wanted a customization page where the user can tailor their app to their liking. 
After the customization is done, the app will then take you to the main swipe page where the AI will tailor speciifc dishes for the user and the user has the option
to either swipe right and match with the dish or swipe left and disregard the option presented to them. I am still working on how the othe rwireframes of the app would look like
but that will happen as I develop the web app.
